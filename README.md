How do I approach designing software?
  What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
  I created a 3D rendering of Michigan Stadium, where the Michigan Wolverines play football. As this is my first computer graphics class, everything that I have accomplished is a new skill that I have developed. So,    choosing something in particular is difficult, but I did find it interesting to how much you can manipulate shapes to act as the way that you want them to.

  What design process did you follwo for your project work?
  The process that I used was to start out simply (to get my feet wet, so to speak) and then work on the complex parts of the project as I got more comfortable working with the project.

  How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
  I feel like that the tactics that I could use in the future, is to attempt to make things as simple as possible. The more complex an area of the project, I found that most of the time there was a simple solution that I could do to get the same effect.

How do I approach developing programs?
  What new development startegies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
  A new stategy that I used more exclusively than I have used it before, is to work on the scene one section at a time. Instead, of attempting to do the whole thing all at once, I found it much easier to work section by section to get the result that I wanted.
  How did iteration facot into your development?
  As my project is not nearly to scale as the actual stadium, I had to make some creative adjustments to get the scene to be as close of a replica as I could to the stadium.
  How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the project's completion?
  I felt that throughout the milestones I got more confident in how to develop the code to what I desired, and as my confidence grew, I felt a lot more comfortable in trying new things to see if they would work better than to what I did previously.

How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
  How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
  I feel like now that I have a good grasp on the basics of how to accomplish things that I would need to do for any future classes that I may take involving computer graphics.
  How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?
  As I'm not entirely sure how I want to use my degree once I achieve it yet, I don't exactly where computer graphics will fit in, but it is good to have a decent foundation of how to do something in case it ever comes up in the future.
